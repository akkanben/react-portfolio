      "description": "Hi, I'm Ben Mills I've spent most of my career managing a small, independent paint-your-own pottery studio in Seattle. Over the years I've spent more and more of my free time tinkering late at night with command line tools, scripts and programming languages. When an opportunity to use these hobbies came up at my last job I was so excited by the challenge and so proud of how it actually turned out that I realized software development was something I could do well and be passionate about. I enjoyed working in customer service and I see those skills I learned, of offering support and being empathetic and patient, to be a huge asset while working together on projectswith a team. Now as a software developer I'm looking for a position were I can work with people that are as curious as I am about learning how technologies work and how to solve new problems. I want to work as a creator and contribute back to the industry I've enjoyed so much as a consumer.",
